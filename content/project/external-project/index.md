title: External Project
summary: In this work, we introduce an end-to-end learning network to predict the orientation of gripper motion for the purpose of separating grasped and tangled objects. We trained a lightweight deep learning network to predict which orientation the gripper should tilt. The experimental result shows when the robot is holding several tangled objects, the generated motion can ensure the robot gets rid of other objects and keep one object in the gripper.
